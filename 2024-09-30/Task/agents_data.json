Born and raised in the Greater Cincinnati area, I developed my deep love and appreciation for Southeastern Indiana at an early age.  Spending time at my grandparent's farm in Cedar Grove was my own personal retreat, my home away from home.  I always vowed I would raise my family here.  Given the opportunity in 2013, my family and I relocated to Dearborn County.  This is one of the best decisions we've made.  It has allowed us to focus more on our familiy, friends, and has given us the space to volunteer as fosters for a Dayton, Ohio dog rescue. While newer to the real estate profession, I have a vast background in customer service, from lending institutions to the nursing field.  I've gained an eye for detail, paying close attention my clients as well as to all aspects of documents and contracts.  I've learned to listen, to your wants, needs, concerns; anything that is important to you.  I've also learned the importance of communication.  This communication allows me to not only find what you are looking for, it also allows me to keep you up to date with what to expect as well as what steps lie ahead. I look forward to working with you in your search for a new home.  If you're looking to list, I'll help to find that special someone who will value and love your home as much as you do."}

I take great pleasure in assisting people with buying and selling homes in Northern Kentucky. A native of Cincinnati, I have lived and raised my family in Northern Kentucky since 1990. Prior to real estate, I was a manager at Procter & Gamble where I developed the strong, disciplined work ethic which I have carried over to my real estate business. Other than showing homes and meeting clients, my hobbies include watching whichever sports team is currently playing. I also enjoy spending time with my family, friends and animals (I have two dogs and a cat). My goal as your realtor is to share my technical skills and extensive knowledge of this community with integrity and an upbeat attitude. I strive to make your real estate transaction as pleasant and seamless as possible."}

First, I surround myself with good people who are striving to be #1. That's why I chose HUFF REALTY! Secondly, identify your clients' goals. Third, implement a plan of actions. Fourth, achieve the goals. Real Estate is a complex business, but the process of selling and buying a home shouldn't be. For me, the process is exciting and enjoyable. Even the unexpected doesn't bother me because of my training and my experiences. My affiliation with Huff Realty, a Berkshire Hathaway entity, provides me with the necessary tools, information and people to educate me and help me serve my clients' needs. I would be honored to be your realtor on your next real estate transaction. When would you like to begin?"}

I can work with you to find the right home at the right price for you, including all the neighborhood amenities that matter - not to mention the essential criteria you have for your ideal home When it's time to move, you need someone who will advertise your home, show to prospective buyers, negotiate the purchase contract, arrange financing, oversee the inspections, handle all necessary paperwork and supervise the closing. I can take care of everything you need, from start to close. Oftentimes buyers don't visualize living in your home the way you do. I can make your home attractive to its ideal audience - which can help you get top dollar. Things like staging the home, making repairs or minor improvements, or even simply painting the walls can be the difference between a home resting on the market and one that's sold fast."}
