1.Task completed: Completed pending programming task using requests + parsel 
                  modules(without using scrapy-assignment 2 project) 

  Modified the program by splitting entire program into 2 separate programs ,
  one for crawling and one for parsing stages, Firstly crawling program is executed 
  then the parsing program executed by getting the output from crawling stage to
  parsing stage then final output is produced, after execution parsing stage. 
  Here, I tried 2 ways : 
  First way : Executing the program by storing the first stage result into text file then 
  that file is put into parsing stage for further processing and output is produced at end.
  Second way : Connecting with mongodb for storing the data generated during the first & second stages,
               execution of program is similar as first way.
