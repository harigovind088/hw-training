These partnerships and connections allow clients to feel at ease and know that every step of the process is being held with the utmost care and urgency. The agency has also partnered with a property management company that allows for their clients to have a one stop approach to real estate. 803 Realty rebranded in June of 2020, after first opening its doors as Williams Real Estate Group in January 2016 as a full service residential real estate company. Tim and the other 42 agents pride themselves on their VIP client level customer service. They are selling homes 25 days faster than the Midlands average and operate as a one stop shop for both real estate sales and rentals. Tim is continually expanding to service communities throughout the 803 area code. He recently announced the expansion of their sales force to the Aiken/North Augusta market. The agency continues to focus on finding new ways to serve the community by joining multiple charitable foundations and business leaders that work to beautify the town and encourage growth and diversity. Everyday, Tim gets to help individuals and families with one of the largest purchases of their life, real estate. Not only that, but he also gets to mentor agents who work with 803 Realty and learn new ways to serve the community and build the business. Tim is grateful how his work in this service industry has touched his life. He shared that life is a beautiful thing that we must all be grateful for and that success should be defined by the individual, not a company or corporation. \"I feel as though in this industry and in any 'luxury industry' there is too much pressure on agents to work towards driving a certain car or making a certain amount of money,\" he said. \"We all have different levels of comfort when it comes to living and different things we are working toward. I feel as though it's important as a company that we promote that individuality because that's what makes this community thrive and great\". 803 Realty will always remain locally owned and operated, putting their clients and community first. Visit 803 Realty at 5599 Sunset Boulevard or at www.803realtylexington.com . Tim and his wife Cidney, are quite involved in Lexington, from helping out at the schools their four children attend to taking part in city beautification projects. They also love Lake Murray - the jewel of South Carolina. \" I love time with my family and vacationing\", Tim adds. \"They are the center of my world.\"", "languages": [], "image_url": "https://www.century21.com/c21/remote-media/affiliate-4x5-316w/052/e33/91/aHR0cHM6Ly9jMjEuYXp1cmVlZGdlLm5ldC8xMjI4aTAvMXF6dGhnbTR4eGR0NGQya2hha3ExYzY1Zzdp.jpg", "website": "https://timothywilliamsjr.c21.com", "address": "5599 Sunset Blvd", "city": "Lexington", "state": "SC", "zipcode": "29072", "country": "United States", "social": {}, "email": "", "agent_phone_numbers": ["+1.803.528.9219"], "office_phone_numbers": ["+1.803.490.1877"]}

I am truly fortunate to be one of those people that love what I do and where I get to do it! I think we are very fortunate to live in Northeastern Wisconsin. Wonderful communities, four seasons, neighbors who still know each other's namesâ¦Happy Valley! As an agent, I pride myself on a strong work ethic, high degree of integrity and thorough understanding of the real estate market in the Fox Valley and surrounding areas. I believe these traits set me apart from many agents. I've also won some pretty prestigious awards - they're neat, but wouldn't be possible if I wasn't focused 100% on meeting the needs of my Buyers and Sellers. Selling your Home? Data-driven pricing opinions. Any agent can tell you what you want to hear. I'll tell you what the market is indicating and how to place your home in the best position to get the best price possible. Marketing. Top of the line marketing including: Immediate exposure on MLS Social media exposure Presence on over 350 websites (Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, HomeFinder, etc) On-line virtual tour Open houses Print media Communication. You will hear from me regularly; within 24-hours of a showing and the same day of open houses. Have a question in between - call me! You work with me. I have a wonderful support staff that shuffles the paperwork and allows me to be available to you when you need me. Buying a Home? Solid understanding of home construction. This allows me to educate and assist buyers as they compare and contrast the homes they are viewing. Not all homes are constructed the same, I will explain the difference. Strong financial background. This aids in my working with savvy investors, first-time buyers and individuals who have purchased a home in the past. Born and raised in the Fox Valley - I know the area, the school districts, the local events, the best place for a wonderful Friday night fish dinner - just ask me!

I have a unique understanding of the difference between buying/renting a property to become a \"Home for Now\" and buying/renting a property to finally become your \"Forever Home\"; I truly understand the urgency and emotions involved in either of those choices as well. I have had to reluctantly give up homes, whether selling them or renting them, that I have loved and understand the complexities involved in doing so. I believe that, aside from a child's education, buying a home or investment property is the single largest investment you will ever make and should be taken seriously by whom you chose to trust with the honor of your patronage. I have been involved in the Real Estate Industry for over 20 years. I began as a Receptionist at 18 years old, worked hard and made the natural progression to Marketing Specialist, Listing Coordinator, Stager, and was eventually given the opportunity to act as Office Manager before transitioning into the appraisal industry.

After several years, I transitioned into the custom home market and then worked in property management for seven years. While working in property management, I specialized in working with people transitioning from one place to another including: traveling nurses, doctors, engineers and military families. As a Realtor, I have continued my passion of working with military members and will continue to serve members and all of my clients with loyalty, honesty and integrity. In addition to marketing and selling homes, one of my specialties is new construction. I am there from start to finish and an advocate for my clients during the whole building process. I also enjoy working with first time buyers and walking them through the entire home buying process step by step. Whether you are looking to buy or sell, new or existing, it is always my pleasure to serve as your realtor. Outside of real estate, my other interests are biking, traveling and touring wineries.", "languages": ["English"], "image_url": "https://www.century21.com/c21/remote-media/affiliate-4x5-316w/4eb/bc6/ec/aHR0cHM6Ly9jMjEuYXp1cmVlZGdlLm5ldC8xMTAzaTAvampuZXpqZmJ2Y3ozbXRlemoxeXd5ZDRtNDZp.jpg", "website": "https://michaelbotkin.c21.com", "address": "135 E.

From there I worked many years for the State of Texas protecting the unprotected and along the way buying more properties to add to my real estate portfolio. Then I went into buying commercial properties. After being in the industry and building my portfolio I knew it was time to get my license and start helping others make their dreams come true.

Most of her large extended family lives in Fergus Falls and her ties to this amazing community run deep. Within her first year of real estate career, Leslie hit her goal of being a million-dollar producer and by her tenth year her sales hit over the 14 million mark! She attributes her quick ascent to becoming a top producer in the area to an old-fashioned worth ethic instilled in her by her grandmothers at a very early age. Leslie is fiercely loyal to her clients, working tirelessly to ensure the most positive outcome. One of her clients stated it perfectly, \"You are a real estate agent that cares; you take care of people, you're not out simply for the dollar.\" In fact, Leslie is particularly focused on helping those that need a little extra assistance, with a wealth of experience handling real estate with divorces and estates. When listing a home, effective marketing is crucial, and Leslie's social media marketing is unique and brings results. She is a firm believer in presenting an unforgettable first impression. With 98% of people taking their first view of a home on the internet, professional staging, photography and videography are key components of Leslie's listing package. When working for a buyer, she is thrilled knowing she has helped the client find just the right house to become their home-in fact, she thrives on the challenge of getting the \"ungettable\" for her clients. A former client says, \"Leslie went way beyond the second mile to sell our home in a difficult market and we were able to realize a lifetime dream of buying a home on the water.\" Gregarious by nature, Leslie really enjoys networking and is very involved in her community. A self-confessed \"committee nerd\" Leslie volunteers on various local community, industry and state level boards, such as the Minnesota Association of Realtors Ethics & Professional Standards Committee.

The beauty of the coulee region area, friendly people of our communities and the ability to do many diverse activities; I cannot see myself living anywhere else. My husband and I have 1 son, Colton. We have horses, 1 mini-donkey and of course the family dog. I'm a country gal and I love to ride horses, garden, kayak, cross country ski, fish with my son, read a good book, drink a fine glass of red wine, and overindulge in cheese. I'm a true Midwesterner! My past background is in property management/rental properties, renovation, and restoration of older homes. I grew up working on properties with my family as our family business along with beef farming. Before starting my real estate career in 2004, I purchased my own homes to remodel/restore and managed my own rental properties which I still have today. We also enjoy restoring an old home from time to time. Our last 3 projects were all in Fountain City, Wi. My husband and I started the \"Great River Road Inns\" which is being run by new owners now. These beautiful older homes that founded our communities need preservation and restoration to endure there next several generations. My husband and I own the \"Golden Frog Restaurant and Saloon and The Lily Pad\" in Fountain City, Wi. My husband man's that \"ship\" and we have a wonderful team of long-term employee's.

I spend time researching and training on the newest technology in order to stay ahead of the competition. I am familiar with Maryland, Virginia, and the Washington DC area since I have been a resident in Maryland since 1998. I have raised my children here from newborn to teenagers thus far. Background: Before I began my career in Real Estate, I had a vast array of professional experiences.

Clearly during a global pandemic was a unique time to begin a career in real estate, but Cortney's infectious upbeat attitude and nurturing personality, along with her commitment to learning, made the transition an easy one. Cortney imparts knowledge with patience and empathy, and in a way her clients can absorb and understand - a true gift that was aided by years in the classroom.

You can often find Cortney and her Hoosier-fan-family, which includes Cortney's three kids, Brody 15, Zane 13, and Maggie 11 (and a yorkie-pom named Winnie) at tons of sporting events including everything IU! They love to go to baseball games, including her son's travel team, riding bikes on the B Line, and going camping. As you can tell, Cortney is all about family.

It is my desire that each of my clients feel like they are the only client I have. I have been in the real estate industry since 1995. Originally from Texas, my husband and I moved to Enterprise, Alabama in 2003. I have grown to love Enterprise and now call Alabama my homeâ¦which is something for a Texas girl to say. I truly love lower Alabama and I know you will love it too. I am very active in my local and state REALTORÂ® Associations. In 2016, I had the honor of serving as the Alabama Association of REALTORSÂ® State President. With membership of over 15,000 strong, my time of service meant I had to depend on other members of my Century 21 Regency Realty team. It was a little difficult for me because I am a \"hands on\" REALTORÂ®. When asked why I served, since it was a volunteer position, it was because of my love for my industry. How could I not give back to the industry that I loved so very much? I truly enjoyed my time of service, meeting so many wonderful REALTORSÂ® across the state, but was never happier than when I could dive back into my own business again. I believe with things always changing, it is important that I stay knowledgeable about my industry and the changes that take place on a regular basis. Education and keeping up to date is big. I have my MRP (Military Relocation Professional) & GRI (Graduate REALTORÂ® Institute) designations. I am certified with USAA to help their members in their relocation process. With over 20 years of experience, I still enjoy meeting new people and find each day exciting and rewarding. In this business, experience truly does matter.

I'm Vanessa Stoddard, and I couldn't be more excited to introduce myself as the Team Lead of the new Stoddard Realty Team at Century 21. As a lifelong resident of Iowa Park, I bring a deep-rooted knowledge of the local area to my work. With 10 years in the real estate game and 5 years as a listed agent, I've seen it all and loved every minute of it! My journey began at 18 as a real estate assistant, with additional experience in insurance. My superpowers? Communication, marketing, problem-solving, and making dreams come true for first-time home buyers, investors, and home sellers. One of my all-time favorite stories involves a first-time homebuyer family who thought owning a home was out of reach. We worked together, overcame the hurdles, and the day they got the keys was pure magic. That's why I do what I do-to build relationships and help families feel welcome and safe in this community. When it comes to working with clients, my philosophy is simple: be knowledgeable about real estate and the local area, put clients' needs first, always be honest, and make sure you know all your options to make the best decision for your unique situation. I also pride myself on being a one-stop shop, connecting clients with trusted lenders, contractors, and more. With my husband William running Stoddard Home Services, specializing in home repair and remodeling, we truly have all your home needs covered! Outside the world of real estate, I'm a creative soul. I love spending quality time with my family-my wonderful husband, William, and our two amazing kids, Killian and Adaline. I enjoy diving into a good book or indulging in my creative pursuits, whether it's painting, digital design, or home decor. My passion for interior design adds a special touch to my work. And here's a fun tidbit: I was a football player and state powerlifter back in the day! ð [https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tc0/1/16/1f3c8.png]ðï¸ââï¸ [https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t98/1/16/1f3cb_200d_2640.png] That must be where I get my toughness and grit.

I'm Natalia, your dedicated Realtor with an unwavering passion for this remarkable state. Since 2001, Alaska has been my home, my heart, and my playground. I'm excited to share my journey with you and offer my expertise in helping you navigate the Alaskan real estate market. Rooted in the Last Frontier I put down roots in Alaska when I arrived in 2001 to pursue my education at Alaska Pacific University. Little did I know, I would fall head over heels for this incredible state, making it my permanent home after college. My years in Alaska have been marked by adventure, exploration, and a deep appreciation for the outdoors. Living Life on the Edge Alaska's rugged terrain and untamed wilderness have been my constant companions. I've hiked and scaled mountains all over the state, ventured onto glaciers, embraced the thrill of ice climbing, and carved my way through the backcountry with skis strapped to my feet. The Alaskan wilderness isn't just my playground; it's my sanctuary. Fishing and Guiding on the Kenai River My summers were dedicated to the Kenai River, where I cast my line and reeled in unforgettable memories. After college, I transitioned into guiding, fulfilling my clients' dreams of catching world-renowned trout and salmon in the pristine waters of the Kenai River. This experience instilled in me the importance of fulfilling dreams and making connections, a lesson that transcends my real estate career. Scaling New Heights for a Cause In a testament to my dedication to giving back, I climbed the tallest mountain in Europe, Mount Elbrus, in 2014 as part of a fundraiser to raise money for Easter seals. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of community and the impact we can make when we come together for a meaningful cause. Real Estate: A Path to Financial Freedom My journey in real estate began with a desire to secure passive income for my family. I knew that by helping others find their dream homes and investment properties, I could build a more secure future for my loved ones. My commitment to my clients and my drive to create financial stability have been my driving forces in this industry. Recognitions and Awards In 2022, I was honored to receive the Realtor of the Year award for the Kenai Peninsula, a testament to my dedication to the local community and the real estate profession. I take immense pride in consistently achieving excellence for the last 7 years, earning accolades like the Centurion and the President's Producer Awards from Century 21 for my commitment to providing outstanding service. \"Your Property, My Priority\" My motto, \"Your property, my priority,\" encapsulates the essence of my approach to real estate. Your dreams, your investments, and your future are what matter most to me. I'll go the extra mile to ensure that your real estate journey is smooth, successful, and tailored to your unique needs. Whether you're looking to buy, sell, or invest in Alaskan real estate, I'm here to be your guide, advocate, and trusted partner. The Alaskan real estate market is as diverse and exciting as the Alaskan wilderness itself. Let's embark on this journey together, turning your real estate dreams into a reality. Get in touch with me today, and let's make your Alaskan dreams come true. ~Natalia", "languages": [], "image_url": "https://www.century21.com/c21/remote-media/affiliate-4x5-316w/cd0/a96/74/aHR0cHM6Ly9jMjEuYXp1cmVlZGdlLm5ldC8xMjI4aTAvbnR5bXhkc3hhZGhtNDFqeTd2M24xM2tyYzBp.jpg", "website": "https://nataliaslistings.c21.com", "address": "170 N.

Although professionally, Tresa has only been in real estate for 3 years, personally, she and her husband David have moved approximately 18 times in 28 years. She attributes this to their love of real estate and believes they probably missed their calling to be builders. Besides her family, her love of people and homes is what led her to this industry. The timing was right, and she felt this was the best of both worlds. So, she jumped right in and hit the ground running. In these 3 years, she has been a multi-million-dollar producer each year and earned the Quality Service Pinnacle Producer Award, and Rising Star Award. Tresa prides herself most on providing great customer service above all else. Her goal for her clients is to help them achieve their real estate goals with ease and have a wonderful experience. Purchasing a home is one of the most important life decisions, and she understands the process, always striving to be one step ahead at all times. When she meets clients, her desire is to be more than a business transaction but to become lifelong friends. All of her clients' testimonials really come down to one common denominator: how well she treats them, how important they felt they were to her, and how excellently she took care of them during the process.

She achieved numerous awards for sales, production and service, including the Quality Service and Quality Service Pinnacle Award, CENTURY 21 Master's Ruby and Master's Emerald Awards, Centurion Award and the President's Award for Centurion Producer and Top Quality Service Award. Sandi has been recognized by the Southern Maryland Association of Realtors for numerous Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond awards over the years as well as being a \"Life Member\" of the Distinguished Sales Club Hall of Fame for sales and production. Sandi holds her GRI designation (Graduate of the Realtor's Institute), her ABR (Accredited Buyer's Representative) and her SRS (Seller Representative Specialist) and ePro, as well. Along the way in her 35+ year career in home sales, Sandi has been a Relocation Director, managed a CENTURY 21 Office and she also worked with a local custom home builder in Southern Maryland for eight years, thus increasing her knowledge of land acquisition and development. She was able to work with people through all the different stages of designing/building a home from start to finish. Additionally, she has attended many specialized marketing classes over the years to help achieve results for her sellers and buyers. Sandi has always been a firm believer of giving excellent service to her clients and focusing on their needs. She likes to think of herself and her clients as a \"team,\" looking to achieve the same goal - the sale or purchase of their home (or both)! Sandi really listens to what her clients are saying and what their needs are and diligently pursues meeting those needs. She has always possessed strong negotiation skills to help both buyers and sellers achieve their goals while maintaining a fair, smooth and friendly transaction for both parties involved.

The realtor constantly pressured me to lower my price. I stood my ground and my house sold for 41% more than her suggested list price. I've also had bad experiences on the buying side, losing my dream home to another buyer because my agent never asked me for a best and final offer. That's why I became a licensed realtor...TODAY: I now apply my education, skills and business savvy to help people confidently buy and sell their homes without any regrets. I specialize in the purchase and sale of property in Fernandina Beach, Amelia Island, Yulee and Nassau County.

The criteria used in making this selection was based on REALTOR spirit (faithfulness to real estate laws, regulations, Code of Ethics); activity and volunteer efforts in the community, local association, and committees; commitment to continued education; and business accomplishments, conduct, and service to clients. Andrea consistently earns sales achievement awards, and in 2013, she placed in the top 20 out of nearly 2,000 CENTURY 21 agents in the Great Lakes Region for high sales.
